My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing. I am
currently interested in leveraging context expressed through a world model to
help natural language interpretation and understanding. My other interests are
in using integer linear programming and other methods to create more global
models for natural language processing problems.  This is closely related to my
PhD research in which I focused on developing methods to process, extract and
summarise information from large natural text collections.  In particular I
formalised the compression task within an integer linear programming framework
which allowed new and existing models to be supplemented with linguistic
constraints.

### Interact

We are currently in the process of creating a resource for people interested in
[Integer Linear Programming for Natural Language Processing][ilpwiki].

I co-organised the [Workshop on Integer Linear Programming for Natural Language
Processing][ilpws] hosted at [NAACL HLT 2009][naacl2009]. During this time we
created a resource for people interested in [Integer Linear Programming for
Natural Language Processing][ilpwiki]. More information about the workshop can
be found on the [ILP for NLP wiki][ilpwiki].

You can help our community by participating in our [Language Experiments][lexp].
