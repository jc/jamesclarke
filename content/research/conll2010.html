   abstract: "> Current approaches to semantic parsing, the task of converting text to a formal meaning representation, rely on annotated training data mapping sentences to logical forms. Providing this supervision is a major bottleneck is scaling semantic parsers. This paper presents a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision burden. We present two novel learning algorithms capable of predicting complex structures which only rely on a binary feedback signal based on the context of an external world.  In addition we also reformulate the semantic parsing problem to reduce the dependency of the model on syntactic patterns, thus allowing our parser to scale better using less supervision.  Our results surprisingly show that without using any annotated meaning representations learning with the weak feedback signal can produce a parser that is competitive with fully supervised parsers."
