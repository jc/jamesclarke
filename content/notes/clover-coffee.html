[Clover Food Lab][1] demonstrating their coffee brewing technique:

> We have a pretty specific approach to making our coffee. A lot has gone into
developing our technique. It is a balance of practical concerns (e.g., speed,
consistency), and, but I know that each manager has a slightly different
technique. Weâ€™re not talking huge differences here, but I was pretty sure there
were slight variations.

Clover use filter-cone-style brewing and want to achieve a constant flow out of
the cone rather than dripping.
